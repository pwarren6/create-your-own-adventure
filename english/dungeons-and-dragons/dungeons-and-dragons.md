You roll... 3...15...12...11...8...19!  Ooh, so close, almost a critical.
Nevertheless it's good enough to hit the Cacode..err...Beholder.
You deal 2d6+3 damage!

Watch out, the Beholder looks angry and he's about to attack!
[Roll the dice](beholder-attacks/beholder-attacks.md) and see what happens!
